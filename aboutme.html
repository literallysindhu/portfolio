    <h2>Life is so much more than just Code and Coffee:</h2>
    <p>At a certain point of time, everyone's life becomes a certain cycle of two things: Work and a pleasure that is used EXCESSIVELY. For me, my life has become a cycle of Code and Coffee. I wake up and I get down to work, finishing the modules of a newly purchased course as i sip the fresh filter coffee that my mom has made me. I type and I sip, type and sip, type and sip till it strikes me that my cup is far beyond empty. Then, my mom refills the cup.Type and Sip, Type and Sip.. and its empty again. <br>It is a crucial yet necessary cycle isnt it? So, the next time your cup's empty, put it down for a while. Give it a break. Give yourself a break. Shut down your already heated up laptop, which would be crying its processor off, if it weren't for the exhaust fan. Change into something comfortable and make that cup of coffee by yourself. Go outside, inhale the fresh air and feel the sunlight on your skin. This is the best way to prevent burn outs and to ensure conistency in all the things. Life's good.</p>
