    <h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Apart from my main interest being Coding, I have passion for other things such as:</p>
    <h2>Music:</h2>
    <p>Music isn't just a background sound for me; it's the lifeline that syncs with my every mood. Whether it's a calm melody that wraps around me like a warm hug or an upbeat track that makes me want to dance like no one's watching, music has a way of speaking what words often can't.

It's my escape, my therapy, my celebration. From lyrics that feel like they were pulled straight from my diary to beats that pulse like a second heartbeat, every song tells a storyâ€”and sometimes, it feels like mine.

I could get lost for hours in a playlist, finding comfort, joy, and even answers in the harmonies. Music isn't just something I hear; it's something I feel, deeply and completely. It's the magic that turns moments into memories, and honestly, I don't think I'd ever want to imagine a world without it. ðŸŽ§âœ¨
    <h2>Gaming:</h2>
    <p>Gaming isnâ€™t just a hobby for meâ€”itâ€™s a whole vibe, an alternate reality where I can pause the world and step into new adventures. Itâ€™s the thrill of mastering a tough level, the joy of unlocking hidden achievements, and the endless satisfaction of just vibing with a controller or keyboard in hand.

I love how gaming blends challenge and creativity, strategy and spontaneity. Itâ€™s not just about the graphics or the gameplay; itâ€™s the stories, the characters, and the worlds that feel so alive they could be real. Whether Iâ€™m battling enemies, solving puzzles, or just exploring beautiful virtual landscapes, gaming is where I feel most free and most *me*.

Itâ€™s my way to connect, unwind, and sometimes even compete (because letâ€™s be real, winning feels amazing). Gaming isnâ€™t just playingâ€”itâ€™s living a thousand lives, all from the comfort of my chair. GG, life. ðŸŽ®âœ¨


</p>
    <h2>Writing:</h2>
<p>Writing is a beautiful escape, a way to express thoughts, emotions, and creativity. It allows us to paint pictures with words, share stories, and connect with others. The joy of crafting sentences, the thrill of completing a piece, and the power of influencing readers make writing truly magical. For those who love it, writing is not just a skillâ€”itâ€™s a passion. </p>
